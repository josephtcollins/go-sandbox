# Go Sandbox

General use sandbox for becoming more familiar with go.

Init written while going through [Stephen Grider's Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/go-the-complete-developers-guide).

_Some notes_

- There are no generics in go.
- Interfaces are implicitly recognized, not called out explicitly.
